# Random-Sound-selection-app
Based on a weird thing I do when playing games. 1 hour of silence with *insert sound* played randomly. Lets automate and configure that.

Hello, this was made by Nick Watkins/Creeperhaten for fun. So have fun with it to. 

Place .wav files in Hamburger Sounds for the app to process and randomly play, make sure that all .wav files do not use spaces in the name.
